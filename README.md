Considering the dynamic effect of the "Dove of Peace", I chose to refer to the exploded view of the bird taking off to conceive the animation effect that the "Dove of Peace" picture can show. I hope to show the flying posture of the pigeon in the animation, and interactively display the different states of the pigeon during takeoff through mouse clicks.
simple flow chart:dove::dove::dove:: spread wings - jump - take off

“let attracting = true; //鼠标是吸引还是抵抗”

“function preload() {”

“img = loadImage('d.png');”

“font = loadFont('Gotham.otf');”

This kind of code can initially realize the mouse attraction effect, which can be applied to the picture of peace dove. The bird moves towards the mouse.

The code shown is not complete, but it is enough for reference on how to animate a bird flying. I will use PR painting and separate the wings from the body.
